# ‚òëÔ∏è Checklist App

This is a Flutter project that utilizes Fastlane and GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) automation.

Fastlane is a command-line tool for automating common development tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying mobile apps. It allows us to define a series of steps that we want to automate as part of our development workflow, and then execute them with a single command. With Fastlane, we can automate the process of building, testing, and deploying our app, as well as many other common development tasks.

GitHub Actions is a powerful platform for automating workflows, including CI/CD pipelines. GitHub Actions has been set up to automatically  test and deploy the app to the stores when changes are made to the repository.

## üìù Articles
In addition to the code in this repository, two articles have also been published that explains how Fastlane and GitHub Actions was set up for this project. I hope that these articles will be helpful to other mobile app developers who are interested in streamlining their development workflows and improving the quality of their code.
